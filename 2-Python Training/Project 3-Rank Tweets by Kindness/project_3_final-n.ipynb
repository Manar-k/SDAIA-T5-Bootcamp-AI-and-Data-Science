        "**Sentiment Analysis**: Social media can be a great place to connect with others and share positive thoughts and experiences. However, it can also be a breeding ground for negativity and hate speech. This project aims to develop a system to rank tweets by kindness in order to promote more positive and supportive online interactions.\n",

        "**Benefits:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The proposed system has the potential to provide a number of benefits, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Promoting more positive and supportive online interactions\n",
        "- Reducing the spread of negativity and hate speech\n",
        "- Helping people to find and connect with others who share their values\n",
